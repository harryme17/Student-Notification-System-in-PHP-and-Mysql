# Student-Notification-System-in-PHP-and-Mysql
The Student Notification System is a web app created during my diploma studies. It enables staff to send notifications and manage student attendance using PHP, MySQL, XAMPP, and Bootstrap. The system features a minimalistic UI with potential for enhancements like user authentication and SMS/email integration.
